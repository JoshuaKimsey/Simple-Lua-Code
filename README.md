###What you need to run this program

This program requires the Lua Programming Language to successfully run! 

You can download the Lua Programming Language here: https://www.lua.org
Navigate to Downloads and install the stable release

Windows and Mac users will need to install the language in order for this program to work.

For Linux users, some Linux Distros come prepackaged with Lua. To confirm this, open the Terminal and type in "Lua"
If it opens to a command line for Lua, you should be fine to run this program I made. Otherwise, you will need to install Lua as well.
